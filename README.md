# Singular
I'm planning to create a blog about a fictional person named Amanda Silva, who was created by an AI. I want to showcase her fictional travels to other countries, fantastic places, and more.

My aim is to build a user-friendly content management system for blogs that allows users to easily create, edit, and publish their posts. The system should have a responsive and appealing interface, as well as SEO features to ensure high visibility of the posts in search engines. In addition, users should be able to manage their comments and interact with their readers through the system.
